"""
Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord.

You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this word (1-indexed).

If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.
