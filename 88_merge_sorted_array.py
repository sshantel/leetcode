Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

>>> merge([1,2,3,0,0,0], 3, [2,5,6], 3)
[1,2,2,3,5,6]
